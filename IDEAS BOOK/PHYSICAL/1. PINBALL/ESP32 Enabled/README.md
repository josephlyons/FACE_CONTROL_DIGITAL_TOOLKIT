# ESP32 Enabling

This is a guide to taking a project based on Arduino and locally controlled and translating it onto ESP32 Dev Boards as to allow it to be controlled by processing via Shiftr.io. I will show two examples - controlling the project with keyboard keys & controlling it with your eyebrows!

## What is an ESP32?

An ESP32 is a microcontroller board used for the development of WiFi & Bluetooth enabled projects.

## Which one do I buy?

Any ESP32 Dev board that you can buy should be fine as long as it works! However for ease of use, getting a pre-solded board with mounts makes prototyping much easier & faster. I also chose to get a board that resembles an Arduino which makes it a little more friendly and easy to understand.
