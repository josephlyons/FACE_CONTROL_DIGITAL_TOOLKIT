## Creating a shiftr.io namespace

Go to www.shiftr.io it should look like this:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/josephlyons/FACE_CONTROL_DIGITAL_TOOLKIT/blob/master/IDEAS%20BOOK/PHYSICAL/1.%20PINBALL/ESP32%20Enabled/Creating%20a%20Shiftr.io%20Namespace/images/shiftr.io.png?raw=true)

Create an account & Login. Go to your profile, it should look like (although slightly different to) this:

![enter image description here](https://github.com/josephlyons/FACE_CONTROL_DIGITAL_TOOLKIT/blob/master/IDEAS%20BOOK/PHYSICAL/1.%20PINBALL/ESP32%20Enabled/Creating%20a%20Shiftr.io%20Namespace/images/dashboard.png?raw=true)

Now click "New Namespace" you should see this:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/josephlyons/FACE_CONTROL_DIGITAL_TOOLKIT/blob/master/IDEAS%20BOOK/PHYSICAL/1.%20PINBALL/ESP32%20Enabled/Creating%20a%20Shiftr.io%20Namespace/images/create%20new%20namespace.png?raw=true)

Give it a name and a description if you want. Make it private or not it doesn't really matter.


Go to your Dashboard, Click on the new namespace, it should look like this but with no branches:

![enter image description here](https://github.com/josephlyons/FACE_CONTROL_DIGITAL_TOOLKIT/blob/master/IDEAS%20BOOK/PHYSICAL/1.%20PINBALL/ESP32%20Enabled/Creating%20a%20Shiftr.io%20Namespace/images/namespace.png?raw=true)

Then click "Namespace Settings" it should look similar to this:

![enter image description here](https://github.com/josephlyons/FACE_CONTROL_DIGITAL_TOOLKIT/blob/master/IDEAS%20BOOK/PHYSICAL/1.%20PINBALL/ESP32%20Enabled/Creating%20a%20Shiftr.io%20Namespace/images/namespace%20settings.png?raw=true)

Here you can see your MQTT address. The two numbers on your dashboard that are in place on mine of "90a85098" & "a7fed12984960679", are what you are going to use within the ESP32 enabled pinball project.
